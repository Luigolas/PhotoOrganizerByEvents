PhotoOrganizerByEvents
======================

This is a personal project to put some order in my personal photos.
I have so many photos, from many different sources that it is a big effort to put some order to them.
This application is designed to order all the photos in folders depending on the event.
That means that photos are separated when a time gap is detected.
